# Student Information System (SIS)

A simple **C++ WinForms project** demonstrating CRUD operations with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  

This project was developed to manage student records in a desktop application.

1. **Full CRUD operations (Add, Read, Update, Delete)**
   - Add new student records with Name & Age
   - View all records in a GridView
   - Update selected records
   - Delete one or multiple records

2. **File-based persistence (`data.txt`)**
   - Save all student data to a text file
   - Load data from the file to restore records
   - Ensures data is retained when the app is closed

3. **GridView display for student records**
   - Displays all students in a structured, easy-to-read table
   - Allows easy selection and manipulation of records

4. **Built following OOP principles**
   - `Student` class stores individual student info
